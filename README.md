# Linux System Monitoring
I created  a simple bash script that displays CPU,memory, and disk usage that refreshes every 5 seconds.
This project displays real time information about system resource usage. The project is also designed for linux learners like myself and junior system/cloud engineers to understand system metrics and automation with shell scripting.

# Feautures
-Dispays CPU usage
-Displays memory usage
-Displays Disk Usage
-Shows running processes
-Runs entirely in the terminal 
-Lightweight and fast

#Usage
Make Executable 
chmod +x monitor.sh
./monitor.sh
